## entry 5/10 ##

continuing on the Morbly sketch. I now put github on my phone, which makes life easier. I can't be bothered in making screenshots and documenting more. I don't necessarily like having to log everytime I change a minor detail like a shoulder or what not. But sofar I have taken the standard goblin design, changed the proportions a bit, and now I'm going to do a first outline. I'm feeling somewhat positive about it all, and I might be able to get it done today. 

17:33 : I think I have most of the outline complete. It's a little hard to get the right experession and mix of cute and horror that I think Scott would appreciate. I'm working in the sun in lafotaine, which is making the overall experience much, much better

17:58 outline complete, once again I hate everything. 

18:07 the sun has gone down in the park, so now I have to relocate. I do feel like I'm getting the hang of procreate again, and that I was quite rusty for the first drawing. Feeling relatively positive

## Entry 4/10 ##

I have a sort of rough draft, that I completed about a week ago. I am currently stuck in the most boring meeting of my life, hence the github updates. I might be able to do the monster sketch soon, as well as the other one over the weekend. Then I can send that and have one final week for final edits. 
My God, this meeting is boring. I'll probably go for a goblin-ish look mixed with that biology visual style. 

## Entry 10:32 18/9 ##
Back to the grind and the base colour. 
10:53 figure I needed to make the estate redder to catch the eye better

10: 20 base colour is done

11:35 doing shading, still hate everything about this, but we struggle on. It'll be okay in the end. I hate that I worked myself in such a massive time crunch.

## Entry 8:23 ##
still working on the base colour, but I have to stop because I'm tired as hell. I'll have to finish it tomorrow. RIght now we're still at the stage of: I hate everything about this, but I know once I start adding detail and shade, it'll come together again. Thinking of draining the colour out in post to give it a bit more of a horror-y look

## Entry 7:45 ##
Line out of gate is done now too. I've cut a couple corners to speed things up. But now it's on to the fun part. Shading.

## Entry 7:13 ##
line out is done now on to the gate. Could I have done a better job? Certainly. But I can fix some of it when colouring and shading

## Entry 17/9 7:09 ##
continuing to work on the line out, after which things should get easier. Meanwhile, I am getting mad at myself that I should have done this ages ago, and how am I supposed to do the whole thing in less than 3 hours. Anyways, we struggle on with my disability of being able to draw a tree and refusal to look it up. 

## Entry 17/09 - work ##

- estate, stable, path and cliff

## Entry 17/09 - pre work ##
Did not do anything over the weekend. Quelle surprise, so now I am just going to treat it as work. I hope to be able to set up a vague sketch in the next 90 minutes

- make the estate sketch
  - estate has wrought iron gates
  - stables to the left
  - three tiered fountain in the middle
  - curated path leading to a cliff to the right
  - main building has 2 stories
  - marble pillars and carvings
  - wooden doors
  - gothic horror
  - (curtain flapping in the wind on the first floor & shadow holding a weapon)
  - 

## Entry 13/09 ##

Let's see if I can maybe get together an idea for a sketch, on which I can reflect here. As well as maybe a very first outline. Or, best case scenario do one full illustration, but with commits in between.

## Notes about the game ##

First the house from afar: The entrance to the estate is as grand as the player’s entrance, and as mysterious as the letters they received to welcome them. The wrought iron gates curve in mesmerizing patterns  that draw a visitor's eyes through the estate’s expanse. Looking through, to their left players can make out a set of stables while a gorgeously curated path heads to the edge of a cliff to their right. Central is a three tiered fountain with each segment seemingly floating and pouring the sparkling water down. 
The Main building sits as a two story impressive feat of architecture with its marble pillars and carvings pulling attention. Seeing through the windows is difficult from here, but it seems that each time players look at it is seemingly shifting.

Scenario Document
Scenario Document Laying out the Estate Wispervine is not a small place. There are a plethora of rooms, places, and people to interact with. To help keep this understood, the following is a summary of each room including: a description, the DC number of loot, any potential monsters, and mention...

For the Characters, You have descriptions of their classes in this document - https://docs.google.com/document/d/12CzQGvUrYdKglitHV0okRGxOKogZbTng2VnWE_K0tkY/edit?usp=sharing But I think that just using what they have offered as descriptions is bettter. So depending on who you draw we can ask for that.

For the house staff, I have some minor visuals in my notes:

William McFaoe - The Butler of the estate.
A proper, put together, and organized gentleman, William’s goal is to make sure the estate is always in tip top shape and that its guests and staff always have a good time.
Herring/Flag: William, while not responsible for the murder himself, did indirectly insinuate that Klivar should die. He wrote about it in his journal, discussing how an end to the groomsman might satiate the undead’s woes.
Alibi: William was in the kitchen with Morbli and the chef confirming the food requirements for the party members and wedding.
Morbli FNS - Butler’s assistance
Morbli is a small fleshwarp minion. Wearing a skirt, and constantly trying on different hats, he seeks to appease, but his main goal is to make sure the Mansion is kept in tip-top shape, and that the guests are having a good time.
Herring/Flag: Morbli’s ability to shift space and time and teleport makes them a suspicious candidate for their mobility. It would also be known that Klivar had insulted and been rude to Morbli on more than one occasion.
Alibi: At the time of murder Morbli had been preparing to meet the party in the Jungle. He had been in the kitchen prior
Evie Mossbottom - The Gardener
A happy go lucky leshy, Evie will always be talkin to the plants to a point where some say she is insane.
Herring/Flag: Her garden is home to many wonderful species, some of which can be used to make serums, but also can be used to attract animals.
Alibi: Evie was practicing her weather control as she learned that her plants wanted more than just sunny and rainy days, so she was experiemneting with thunder and lighting much to the begrudge of William and Morbli.
Saanvi Raoni - Head Chef
A passionate cook, and even more passionate artists, Saanvi is a Haathodon who has commanded the kitchen for at least  10 years.
Herring/Flag: They prepared a nighttime snack for Klivar on the night before his death. They also might be one of the most proficient weapon wielders in the estate.
Alibi: Saanvi was meeting with William and Morbli to discuss the dinner plan for the new guests.
Arya Klinja - Magical Maid
Arya is a vampire who has an eye for beauty. Good friends with Saanvi, Arya, maintains the layouts of the room. 
Herring/Flag: They would have had the most access to Klivar’s room, and their vampire fangs would resemble animal bites.
Alibi: The murder happened during the day and Arya is typically sleeping by then.
Tostle Turnbrucket - Animal Master 
Tostle is a gruff dwarven druid who watches over the animals of the estate. Tostle is quite to the affairs of the estate and is just happy to have a menagerie to care for.
Herring/Flag: The Mashoonds belong to him alongside various other animals. His distance from others makes him somewhat of a suspicious enigma to the party.
Alibi: He was taking the Hyena horses through an interplanar jaunt.
Kilvar Gintuck - Partner 1
A dead elf. A showdog judge and mocked the animals in the past. Esteemed animal show. Gave her the prize.
Their spirit has been trapped in the home
Jeisl Trintol - Possessed Partner 2
A dead half-orc
Their body is being possessed by an angry and in love spirit Younir
Younir Wimble - Possessor
A hopelessly romantic gnome spirit, Younir has been looking for love and thought they 
rmi was having his daily dish session with his “tea” spirits.
Vesephamir - Spirit Keeper and in house sorcerer
Vesephamir is a sorcerer trained in the arts of necromancy and helps maintain the spirit of the house. A goblin with a lot of self esteem issues, Vesephamir does not enjoy being accused but can be a loyal ally. He loves to talk to the spirits and get their feedback.
Herring/Flag: Naturally being a necromancer would cause suspicion. Additionally, he loves to sew drama between the spirits while also looking to lay them to rest. Given that Younir cannot rest til love is found it will be hard for him to balance his two goals.
Alibi: Vesepha
God that text got weirldy formatted :S
I dont think it is that helpful, but if you need more let me know. Also that first doc I sent you has an AI image of Morbli if you want to use that for inspiration.

## The commisison itself ##

Okay so for the book, I am looking for about 3 pieces of Art.
- One image that is a scene or shot (I would imagine either a still of the estate OR perhaps that opening fight near the fountain and front of the estate)
- One image of a character or characters that were played by the party
- A key character in the game. Perhaps the spirits in the house, or one of the staff, or maybe even Morbli?


## start - Entry 13/09/2023 ##

Had a GAR meeting today in which Vadim mentioned he would maybe use MDM to help him out of a writersblock for his music. I thought that maybe this could work for this commision for 3 illustration for a book I have been endlessly pushing around and for which I have a hard deadline next Friday.
